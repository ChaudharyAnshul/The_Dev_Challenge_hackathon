## Overview

AiJobSync is a revolutionary Job Recommendation System designed to streamline and enhance the job search experience by centralizing the job search process and by analyzing user uploaded resumes. Our platform provides tailored job recommendations from top platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and SimplyHired. Users gain direct access to recommended job listings, ensuring a personalized and efficient job search experience.

## Problem Statement

### Challenge:
The current scenario for the job search process is really tiresome and exhilarating for job seekers. A user currently has to go through every job portal manually, browse through the available jobs, and make a profile describing the role he/she is targeting; which consumes a lot of time. We wanted to optimize the process by making an application that will bring jobs from different portals and filter them based on the user's resume, by using modern technologies, hence easing the process for job seekers.

### Solution:
The objective of AiJobSync is to develop and deploy an efficient RAG solution for a Job Recommendation System, which facilitates the seamless matching of job seekers with relevant employment opportunities based on their uploaded resumes. Unlike traditional job search platforms, our system will aggregate jobs from several portals, utilize advanced data processing techniques to analyze the content of user's resumes, and recommend suitable job openings from various sources such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and SimplyHired. The system will not only match job seekers with relevant positions but also provide direct access to the recommended job listings through provided links.
